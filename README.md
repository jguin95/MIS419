# MIS419

For the final project in MIS 419 we were asked to create a website, android application, overview video, and doccumentation for a hypothetical 
construction company. This repository contains all my source code and documentation for this project.

Below is a brief description of each subfolder within this repository:
  Database_Info - Contains create statements for my MySQL database.
  PDF_Documents - Contains all my documentation that I was required to turn in.
  Source_Code   - Contains 2 folders which have all my website and application code.
  Br_Instructions.pdf - Is a document that was initially meant to give my teacher some guidance on how to log in to my website.
                        It includes valid log-in info for each user class. I'm including it in the repository just because it 
                        was part of the project. I don't really care if you log in as an owner and change some minor stuff, 
                        but I would ask that you respect my site and don't delete anything.
